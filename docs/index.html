<p><strong>Conceal Network</strong></p>
<p><br />=== Mission Statement ===</p>
<p>Conceal.Network is a decentralized blockchain bank that permits users to anonymously send and receive funds, messages, and earn interest on deposits. This is all done using a public ledger, allowing &ldquo;hack-proof&rdquo; transactions. At Conceal.Network, we believe banking privacy is a fundamental right and we are paving the way to make that happen. Our primary objective is to provide a privacy framework for social inclusion through decentralization of financial services.</p>
<p>Conceal.Network is based on the Cryptonote protocol. For more information please click <a href="https://cryptonote.org/whitepaper.pdf">https://cryptonote.org/whitepaper.pdf</a>|CryptoNote V 2.0]].</p>

<p>=== Decentralized Banking ===</p>
<p>Conceal.Network is an open source private cryptocurrency (a peer-to-peer digital cash system). Deposits form the backbone of the Conceal.Network ecosystem, providing users with an egalitarian framework to Cold Stake ₡CCX, the native coin of Conceal.Network. Cold Staking is a timed deposit you earn compounding interest on when the locked deposit matures. Users privately choose the length of the staking period and the amount of ₡CCX to be staked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=== Private Transactions ===</p>
<p>Transactions in the Conceal.Network use a minimum level of ring signatures to obfuscate the origins and destinations of all transactions, ensuring they are untraceable and unlinkable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=== Encrypted Messaging ===</p>
<p>Conceal.Network offers censorship-resistant encrypted communications. A true decentralized, anonymous, untraceable, and end-to-end encrypted messaging service that operates on the blockchain that offers the option of self-destructing messages. Future releases will include web and mobile messaging applications.</p>
