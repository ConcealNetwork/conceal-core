=== Mission Statement ===

Conceal.Network is a decentralized blockchain bank that permits users to anonymously send and receive funds, messages, and earn interest on deposits. This is all done using a public ledger, allowing “hack-proof” transactions. At Conceal.Network, we believe banking privacy is a fundamental right and we are paving the way to make that happen. Our primary objective is to provide a privacy framework for social inclusion through decentralization of financial services. 

Conceal.Network is based on the Cryptonote protocol. For more information please click [[https://cryptonote.org/whitepaper.pdf|CryptoNote V 2.0]]. 

=== Decentralized Banking ===

Conceal.Network is an open source private cryptocurrency (a peer-to-peer digital cash system). Deposits form the backbone of the Conceal.Network ecosystem, providing users with an egalitarian framework to Cold Stake ₡CCX, the native coin of Conceal.Network. Cold Staking is a timed deposit you earn compounding interest on when the locked deposit matures. Users privately choose the length of the staking period and the amount of ₡CCX to be staked. 

=== Private Transactions ===

Transactions in the Conceal.Network use a minimum level of ring signatures to obfuscate the origins and destinations of all transactions, ensuring they are untraceable and unlinkable.

=== Encrypted Messaging ===

Conceal.Network offers censorship-resistant encrypted communications.  A true decentralized, anonymous, untraceable, and end-to-end encrypted messaging service that operates on the blockchain that offers the option of self-destructing messages. Future releases will include web and mobile messaging applications.
